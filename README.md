src/App.tsx & main.tsx: Entry point and router setup

Components and pages: Logical separation of UI features

Services folder (if exists): API fetch logic

Public/: Static images or favicon
```

---
⚙️ Usage Examples Login Flow Navigate to the login page

Enter credentials – the app likely sends them via a POST request to /api/auth/login

Dashboard
Post-login, the admin is redirected to a dashboard view

Dashboard likely fetches user statistics, upcoming events/pools, member counts

Member & Pool Management
Admin can navigate to pages handling:

List, view, approve/reject members

Create, duplicate, cancel or manage pools/events

These flows depend on API endpoints and service implementations within src/services.

🚢 Deployment
Push to main branch
GitHub Action auto-deploys to Vercel
Environment variables (if any) are set in Vercel dashboard
